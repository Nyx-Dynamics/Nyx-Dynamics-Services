**AI Readiness in Healthcare Settings**  
*Guiding AI to Shape a Better Future*

---

## The Problem

Healthcare AI promises transformation—but 99.8% of funded AI interventions fail to meet basic quality standards. Computational precision doesn't guarantee clinical readiness. Algorithms trained on biased data reproduce bias with mathematical objectivity. And the populations who could benefit most are systematically excluded from the evidence base.

## Our Approach

Every engagement applies our **six-question AI Readiness Framework**:

1. **Data Availability** — Is sufficient high-quality data available to build, validate, and monitor?
2. **External Validity** — Does computational precision create false confidence?
3. **Explainability** — Can clinicians trust extrapolated parameters?
4. **Interpretability** — Does transparency enable meaningful human oversight?
5. **Equity** — Do population averages mask disparities?
6. **Readiness** — Should implementation proceed, and under what conditions?

## The AI Readiness Paradox

Rigorous validation exposes uncertainty rather than eliminating it. An algorithm that appears to have all answers is dangerous. One that names its limitations invites trust.

> *Computationally ready ≠ clinically proven*  
> *Theoretically sound ≠ equitably implemented*

These tensions can't be resolved in advance. They must be managed through staged implementation, clear stopping rules, and genuine community partnership.
